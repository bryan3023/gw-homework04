# gw-homework04

## Synopsis

This is the homework deliverable for lesson 4 on Web APIs.

This solution is a mulitple choice quiz game designed to test your knowledge of basic JavaScript. You will have 90 seconds to answer 20 questions, but you incur a 15 second penalty for every wrong answer.

After you're done, you'll be given an opportunity to add your initials to the scoreboard. You'll then be able to see where you ran relative to other players - but only locally within that browser. If you wish, you can clear the scoreboard.
